## Running Unit Test
Should you wish to run the unit tests, you can follow the same instructions as above for the main project, but instead of navigating to TechnologyOneNumberToWordsConverter go to TechnologyOneNumberToWordsConverter.Test.

However as a note, running the unit tests will simply display that it passes all tests as it only outputs its tests if one fails.
